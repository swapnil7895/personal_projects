Naukri Job Application Automation
This is a Python Selenium-based automation script for applying to jobs on Naukri.com. The goal of this project is to automate the process of job applications by scraping job listings and applying to them programmatically.

Features

Apply for Jobs: Automatically applies to jobs based on user-defined criteria.
Handle Captchas: The script tries to handle common captchas (may require manual intervention for complex ones).
Track Applied Jobs: Keeps a record of applied jobs (could be saved in a file or database).
