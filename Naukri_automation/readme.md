2. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium fpdf

3. **Check Chrome Version**

    Open Google Chrome.
    Go to the menu (three dots in the top right corner) → Help → About Google Chrome.
    Note the version number (e.g., 114.0.5735.199).
4. **Download Chromedriver**

    Visit https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
    Download the Chromedriver version that matches your Chrome version.
    Place the chromedriver.exe file in the project directory.
5. **Set user_data_dir in the Configuration File**

    Open the config.py file.
    Update the user_data_dir variable with the path to your Chrome user data directory. For example:
    python
    Copy
    Edit
    user_data_dir = "C:/Users/YourUsername/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data"
6. **Ensure Logged-In Naukri Session**

    Ensure the session is active before running the automation.

#    Running the Automation

1. **Kill Existing Chrome Processes**

    Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
    End any running Chrome processes.

2. **Run the Script**
    Run the main automation script:
    python job_apply.py

Apply for Jobs: Automatically applies to jobs based on user-defined criteria. - (Only easy apply jobs get applied now)
Track Applied Jobs: Keeps a record of applied jobs (could be saved in a PDF file.)

Requirements
Python 3.x
Selenium
ChromeDriver (or other WebDriver of your choice)
Naukri account
